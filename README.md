## About ShopifyImage

The project is an image repository for the Summer 2021 Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Question. 

1. Everyone can view the content of the repository at http://fierce-beach-30399.herokuapp.com/
2. To upload one or multiple images at once you must first sign up and create an account.
3. You can only delete images that you've upload.

Trivia: the four first pictures are designed and draw by me.
