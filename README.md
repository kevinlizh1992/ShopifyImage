## About ShopifyImage

The project is an image repository for the Summer 2021 Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Question. 

1. Everyone can view the content of the repository at http://fierce-beach-30399.herokuapp.com/
2. To upload one or multiple images at once you must first sign up and create an account.
3. You can only delete images that you've upload.
4. The source code can be found on the master branch.

Extra info: 
1. The four first images on the site are designed and draw by me.
2. This project was built with PHP/Laravel and deployed with Heroku. 

Thank you :)
