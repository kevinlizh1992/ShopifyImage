## About ShopifyImage

The project is an image repository for the Summer 2021 Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Question. 

1. Everyone can view the content of the repository at http://fierce-beach-30399.herokuapp.com/
2. To upload one or multiple images at once you must first sign up and create an account.
3. You can only delete images that you've upload.
4. The source code can be found on the master branch.

Extra info: 
1. The four first default images on the site are designed and drawn by me.
2. This project was built with PHP/Laravel, Bootstrap and deployed with Heroku. 
3. Note that on Heroku, the app's dynos have an ephemeral filesystem. This means that files (images) you upload will disappear whenever a dyno restarts or is replaced. This is not yet addressed in this version of the challenge.
   ==> Alternative: use Amazon S3 to host uploaded files https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3

List of future potential features (see PDF diagram files). 
1. Search bar
2. Categories within search bar
        -Photos, icons, vector graphics, illustration, videos/gifs, size compatible with shopify template
3. On each photo from browsing user show
        -Creator name, likes #, favorites #, comments (both on hover on main page and in details page)
4. Allow creator to add tags for searchability 
5. Allow creator to create paid content
6. Visiting photo reveals more info about the creator, other works by the same author, related images with similar tags, dimensions, other infos like views, downloads and more.
